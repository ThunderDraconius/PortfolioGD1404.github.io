	<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">Hello. My name is Cao Minh Tri. I'm 21 years old. I'm a graphic design student in FPT University. My hobbies are drawing pictures, playing games and reading books. I'm inspried to be an 2D artist or illustrator. My home is in Hanoi, Vietnam. I stay with my family, which includes my parents and my grandmother. I prefer cool colors, especially blue, because it makes me chilled and relaxed, and it suits my personality. As an introvert, I prefer staying at home to going outside. However, I would still like to get acquainted with new people and make new friends.</p>
